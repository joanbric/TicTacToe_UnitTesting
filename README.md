# Tic Tac Toe Unit Testing Project

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game project built using **SvelteKit**. The main purpose of this project is to learn and practice **unit testing using Vitest**.

## Technologies Used
- ðŸª›[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/): A modern web application framework for building efficient and highly interactive web applications.

- ðŸ“±[Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/): A set of utilities for testing UI components, focusing on the user behavior and experience.

## Unit Testing

The project is set up with a unit testing framework called Vitest. Vitest allows you to write and run unit tests for your Svelte components.

Each component has its own test file, which follows the naming convention `ComponentName.test.js`.
